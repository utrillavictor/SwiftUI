_The creation of this repository is a way to remind me the extraordinary importance of being prepared; we know that many things will happen at a certain time, but somehow we are still largely unprepared. So hopefully this time, these lessons, like many others, will stick around for a long time._

Projects and other material made while following along with [Paul Hudsonâ€™s 100 Days of SwiftUI course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) -- and many other great tutorials provided by amazing developers.
